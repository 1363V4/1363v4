    <h2><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
    <p>Welcome to my website! I am deeply committed to the art of not committing. I value your privacy, and I believe in transparency, even if it's as clear as mud. This Privacy Policy is designed to inform you about the types of information I don't collect, how I don't use that information, and the steps I don't take to protect it.</p>
    <h3><strong>Information I Don't Collect</strong></h3>
    <p>I am proud to state that I do not collect any personal information from you when you visit my website. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, address, email address, phone number, and most importantly, cookies. I understand that cookies can be delicious, but I have yet to figure out how to bake them, let alone collect them. In fact, the ones I make end up liquid.</p>
    <h3><strong>How I Don't Use Your Information</strong></h3>
    <p>I am technologically challenged. I don't use your information because I don't have it. I don't share it with third parties, I don't use it for marketing purposes, and I certainly don't use it to personalize your experience on my website. I believe in the joy of generic experiences and the thrill of anonymity.</p>
    <h3><strong>My Commitment to Not Protecting Your Information</strong></h3>
    <p>I take your privacy seriously, so seriously that I don't even attempt to protect it. I don't use encryption, I don't have firewalls, and I certainly don't have a team of IT professionals. Why? Because I don't collect your information in the first place. I believe in the power of nothing and the security of emptiness.</p>
    <h3><strong>Changes to My Privacy Policy</strong></h3>
    <p>I reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. If I decide to change it, I won't notify you because I don't have your contact information. I encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how I continue to not collect, not use, and not protect your information.</p>
    <h3><strong>Contact Me</strong></h3>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please don't hesitate to not contact me. I am here to not help you 24/7.</p>
    <p>Thank you for choosing my website, where privacy is not just a policy, it's a lack of capability.</p>
    <h3><strong>Wait... is this AI-generated?</strong></h3>
    <p>Yes sir.</p>
